# Weather Widget
Hi! This is a very simple weather widget application, made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API provided by https://openweathermap.org

This project was a lot of fun to work on and allowed me to learn more about APIs as well solidify some of my basic front-end development skills.

# Usage
Simply type in the city that you would like to check the weather in and press enter!

The files with the source code are provided on **GitHub** if you are inclined to download/clone the repository.
This repository is setup through **GitHubPages** so a demonstration of this application can be viewed at https://codylambertdev.github.io/weather
